# Connect 4 AI Game

## Overview
Welcome to the Connect 4 AI Game! This project is a fun and educational tool designed to explore various AI algorithms and their application in gameplay. It provides an environment where users can interact with different AI opponents, understand their strategies, and learn how these algorithms are implemented.

## Game Description
Connect 4 is a classic two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs.

## AI Opponents
This game includes several AI opponents, each using different algorithms to make decisions. The AI types available are:

1. **Random AI**: This AI makes completely random moves without any strategic planning. It serves as a baseline for comparing more sophisticated AIs.

2. **Minimax AI**: A more advanced algorithm that simulates all possible moves to a certain depth and selects the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances. Minimax is widely used in game theory and is known for its effectiveness in zero-sum games like Connect 4.

3. **Neural Net AI**: This AI uses a neural network to evaluate board states and decide on the best move. It represents a machine learning approach where the AI learns from previous games and improves its performance over time.

4. **Q-learning AI**: This AI employs a reinforcement learning technique called Q-learning. It learns the value of actions in different states through experience and aims to maximize its total reward. Over time, the Q-learning AI improves its strategy by exploring different moves and learning from the outcomes.

### Disclaimer
At the time of this publish, only the Random and Minimax algorithms are tested and working. The Neural Net and Q-learning algorithms will be tested and this disclaimer will be removed after successful testing.

## Learning Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to demystify AI and show that creating effective AI algorithms is accessible and straightforward. Hereâ€™s what you can learn from this project:

- **Understanding AI Algorithms**: Learn how different AI strategies are coded and applied to make game decisions.
- **Hands-on AI Implementation**: Gain practical experience in implementing AI algorithms like Minimax, Neural Networks, and Q-learning.
- **Interactive Learning**: Play against the AI and observe its decision-making process, gaining insights into how AI opponents operate.

## Why Connect 4?
Connect 4 is an excellent choice for this project because:
- **Simplicity**: The rules are straightforward, making it easy to understand and implement AI strategies.
- **Strategic Depth**: Despite its simplicity, Connect 4 offers a rich set of strategies and tactics, providing a meaningful challenge for AI algorithms.
- **Educational Value**: The game's structure allows for clear demonstrations of AI concepts like decision trees, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Future Expansions
There are many ways to expand and enhance this project:
- **Larger Boards**: Increase the board size to add complexity and depth to the game.
- **Additional Features**: Implement new game features such as power-ups, obstacles, or different game modes.
- **Creative AI Uses**: Use the game board as a dot matrix display for messages or art, demonstrating the versatility of AI algorithms.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow multiple human players to play against each other or team up against the AI.

## Conclusion
This project is more than just a game; it's an educational tool designed to make AI accessible and understandable. By exploring the various AI algorithms used in this Connect 4 game, you can gain valuable insights into how AI works and how it can be applied to solve complex problems.
